# Classifications of Matter

Matter is typically characterized by: 

1. Its physical state (gas, liquid, or solid)
2. Its composition (element, compound, or mixture)

## States of Matter

Gas — no fixed volume or shape, and can be compressed or expanded as there is space between the molecules. 

Liquid — distinct volume but no distinct shape, cannot be compressed. 

Solid — definite volume and shape, cannot be compressed. 

## Composition

A **pure substance** (or **substance**) is matter that has distinct properties and a composition that does not vary sample to sample. 

Two types of substances: **elements** and **compounds**. 

- **Elements** are substances that cannot be decomposed into simpler substances.
- **Compounds** are substances composed of two or more elements (e.g. water).

Most elements can interact with other elements to form **compounds**. The elemental composition of a compound is always the same; this is called the *law of constant composition.* 

In a **mixture**, each substance retains its chemical identity and properties. The composition of a mixture may vary in quantities. 

Homogenous mixtures are also called **solutions**, even if they're not liquid. 

# Properties of Matter

- **Physical properties** — can be observed without changing the identity and composition of the substance.
- **Chemical properties** — describe the way a substance may change to form other substances.
    - For example, flammability.
- **Intensive properties** — do not depend on the amount of sample.
    - These can be used to identify substances.
- **Extensive properties** — depend on the amount of sample.
    - For example, mass and volume.

# Uncertainty in Measurement

## Definitions

- **Exact numbers** — numbers whose values are known exactly.
- **Inexact numbers** — numbers whose value have some uncertainty.
    - All numbers obtained from measurement are inexact because of equipment or human errors.
- **Precision** — how closely individual measurements agree with one another.
- **Accuracy** — how closely individual measurements agree with the true value.

## Significant Figures

All digits of a measured quantity, including the uncertain (last) digit, are called **significant figures**. 

Determine significant figures by reading a number left to right and counting digits, starting with the first non-zero digit. 

The zeroes in a number that ends with zeroes but contains no decimal point are assumed to be not significant. 

However, this can be more clearly expressed with scientific notation: 
1.03 \* 10^4 (three significant digits)
1.0300 \* 10^4 (five significant digits)

## Significant Figures in Calculations

### Addition and Subtraction

The result has the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the fewest decimal places. 

Example: 20.42 + 83.1 = 103.52 ⇒ 103.5

83.1 only has one decimal place, so the answer must be rounded to one decimal place. 

### Multiplication and Division

The result contains the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures. 

Example: 6.221 * 5.2 = 32.3492 ⇒ 32

5.2 only has two significant figures, so the answer must be rounded to two significant figures. 

# Dimensional Analysis

**Dimensional analysis** is the practice of multiplying or dividing units along with the numbers. 

The key is using conversion factors, such as this one: 

<Equation text="\frac{2.54 \, \text{cm}}{1 \, \text{in.}}" />

To calculate the units like this: 

<Equation text="(8.50 \, \text{in.}) * \frac{2.54 \, \text{cm}}{1 \, \text{in.}} = 21.6 \, \text{cm}" />

*The inches cancel out on top and bottom leaving just centimeters.*
