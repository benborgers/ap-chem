# Periodic Trends at a Glance

<Table data={{
  "Property": [
    "Atomic Radius\n\nThe distance between the nucleus and the outermost electron.",
    "Effective Nuclear Charge\n\nThe attractive charge of nuclear protons acting on valence electrons.",
    "Ionization Energy\n\nThe energy required to remove an electron from an atom in the gas phase.",
    "Electron Affinity\n\nThe energy change accompanying the addition of an electron to a gaseous atom."
  ],
  "Across a Period": [
    "Decreases\n\nMore protons are added to the nucleus, which pull the electrons in with more force.",
    "Increases\n\nMore protons are added to the nucleus, while the number of repelling electrons in inner shells stays the same.",
    "Increases\n\nThe electrons are held more tightly (see effective nuclear charge), so they're harder to remove.",
    "Increases\n\nEffective nuclear charge increases, which increases pull towards electrons."
  ],
  "Down a Group": [
    "Increases\n\nNew energy levels are added, which are farther from the nucleus.",
    "Decreases slightly\n\nAlthough nuclear charge increases down a group, shielding from added electrons more than counters this effect.",
    "Decreases\n\nValence electrons are farther away from the nucleus, so they're less tightly held.",
    "Decreases\n\nThe electron cloud becomes larger, so new electrons are further from the nucleus and therefore pulled with less force."
