# Equations

This is a calculation-heavy unit. There's a couple formulas you should know, and a couple things to keep in mind: 

<Callout emoji="🤔">
What is <InlineMath text="R" />&nbsp;?

In these formulas, <InlineMath text="R" /> is the universal *gas constant*. It's provided on the AP test formulas sheet in many units — make sure to use the right one that cancels in your stoichiometry.

In these formulas, you should always convert the temperature to Kelvin, <em>even if the problems provides it in Celsius</em>.

## Ideal gas law

*This one's on the AP formula sheet, but you should definitely know how to use it.*

<Equation text="PV = nRT" />

* P = pressure
* V = volume
* n = total moles of substance
* R = gas constant (see above)
* T = temperature (in Kelvin)

## Ideal gas law but with density

*This one is **not** on the AP formula sheet, because it can be derived from the ideal gas law (above).*

<Equation text="PM = dRT" />

* P = pressure
* M = **molar mass**
* d = density (mass / volume)
* R = gas constant (see above)
* T = temperature (in Kelvin)
