# Lattice Energy

**Lattice energy** is the change in energy when an ionic solid goes to its ions in their gaseous states.

Lattice energy increases with: 
* Increasing charge of the ions
* Decreasing size of ions

<Callout>
  When the effective nuclear charge increases, more energy is released when the ionic compound is created, and more is needed to pull the ions back apart.
</Callout>

It is very difficult to directly measure lattice energies for ionic substances, so they are usually theoretically calculated from other data. The other changes add up to the full change from gaseous ions to ionic solid, and their energies can be added together (kind of like Hess's Law). 

*Dr. Barchuk said that we don't need to memorize the exact steps within calculating lattice energy.*

<Callout>
  A higher melting point is associated with a higher lattice energy.

# Types of Bonds

There are three basic types of bonds: 

* Ionic
  * Electrostatic attraction between ions. 
  * Form between a cation and an anion, usually a metal and a nonmetal. 
* Covalent
  * Sharing of electrons. 
  * Form between two nonmetals. 
* Metallic
  * Atoms attracted to electrons which are free to move through the metal.
  * Form between metals. 


# Lewis Dot Structures

## Basics

Lewis dot structures look like this:

![Periodic table with Lewis dot structures overlayed](/assets/lewis-dot-structures.jpg)

The dots represent valence electrons. Notice that four electrons must be present before subsequent electrons are paired. 

## Covalent bonds and Lewis dot diagrams

Sharing electrons to make covalent bonds can be demonstrated using Lewis structures. 

The **octet rule** says that each electron should have a total of eight valence electrons (or zero, since the next level of 8 electrons becomes valence). The exception to this rule is hydrogen, which only needs two valence electrons. 

<Callout>
  In reality, only C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, and Al follow the octet rule 100% of the time.
</Callout>

How to draw a Lewis structure for covalent molecules: 

*Example: <InlineMath text="\text{PCl}_3" />*

1. Sum the valence electrons from all atoms, taking into account overall charge. 

  <InlineMath text="\text{P}" /> has 5 electrons, and each <InlineMath text="\text{Cl}" /> has 3 electrons, so there are 26 total electrons. 

2. Arrange the symbols for atoms correctly, and connect the atoms. 

  The central atom is the atom of lowest affinity for electrons, since it will be donating the most electrons. Often, but not always, this is the first element in the formula, but it's never <InlineMath text="\text{H}" />.

  In this case, the central atom will be <InlineMath text="\text{P}" />, and the three <InlineMath text="\text{Cl}" /> atoms will each be attached to the central atom. 

  Each bond is two electrons, so there are <InlineMath text="26 - 6 = 20" /> electrons left. 

3. Complete octets around all atoms bonded to the central atom. 

  Each <InlineMath text="\text{Cl}" /> atom gets 6 electrons. Therefore, there are <InlineMath text="20 - 3 * 6 = 2" /> electrons left.

4. Place any leftover electrons on the central atom. 

  There are two electrons left, so we place both electrons in a pair on <InlineMath text="\text{P}" />. It then has all eight electrons, and we've used up all 26 electrons. 

5. If there are not enough electrons to give the central atom an octet, try multiple bonds. 

## Resonance Structures

For some molecules we use multiple structures, called **resonance structures**, to accurately depict the bonds. The â†” symbol is used to indicate multiple resonance structures. For example, ozone: 

![The two resonance structures of ozone](/assets/ozone-resonance-structures.png)

The electrons that are shared by multiple atoms are called **delocalized electrons**, whereas normally the electrons are **localized electrons**. 

In order to determine which resonance structures are more *dominant*, we calculate **formal charge**. Formal charge is the charge an atom would have if all of the electrons in a covalent bond were shared equally. 

<Equation text="\text{formal charge} = \text{valence electrons} - \frac{1}{2} \ \text{bonding electrons}" />

![Diagram of calculating formal charge](/assets/formal-charge.png)

The dominant resonance structure: 
* is the one in which atoms have formal charges closest to zero.
* puts a negative formal charge on the most electronegative atom, if needed.

## Exceptions

### Odd number of electrons

Though relatively rare and usually quite unstable and reactive, there are ions and molecules with an odd number of electrons. For example:

<Equation text=": \text{N} \cdot \ {=\mathrel{\mkern-3mu}=} \ : \text{O} : \ \ \ â†” \ \ \ : \text{N} : \ {=\mathrel{\mkern-3mu}=} \ : \text{O} \cdot" />

### Fewer than eight electrons

Certain elements in the second period (<InlineMath text="\text{Li}" />, <InlineMath text="\text{Be}" /> and <InlineMath text="\text{B}" />) can make stable compounds with fewer than eight electrons. 

![A Lewis structure for boron trifluoride, where boron has only six valence electrons](/assets/lewis-structure-exception-fewer-than-8.png)

*Here, fluorine is highly electronegative, so it does not want to give any electrons to boron.*

### More than eight electrons

When an element is in period 3 or below in the periodic table, it can use *d*-orbitals to make more than four bonds. 

This often happens when outer atoms are highly electronegative.

![A Lewis structure for phosphorus pentafluoride, where phosphorus has more than eight valence electrons](/assets/lewis-structure-exception-more-than-8.png)

*One would actually have to draw four resonance structures with five bonds on the phosphorus atom, making four structures similar to the rightmost structure above. This is because there are four ways to place the double bond.*

## Tricks for drawing Lewis structures

### HONC ðŸ¦†

**H**ydrogen, **O**xygen, **Ni**trogen, and **C**arbon usually make 1, 2, 3, and 4 bonds, respectively. 

### Oxidation numbers

You can use oxidation numbers to predict whether a molecule will have an extended octet. 

For example, in <InlineMath text="\text{PO}_4 \, ^\text{3-}" /> [O's oxidation number is -2](/unit-4/#oxidation-numbers). Since the overall charge of the molecule should 3-, the charge of P is +5. Therefore, S should give away 5 electrons and will have 5 covalent bonds. 


# Electronegativity

**Electronegativity** is the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself. On the periodic table, electronegativity generally increases from left to right and bottom to top. 

<Callout>
  The four most electronegative elements are, in order, fluorine, oxygen, chlorine, and nitrogen.
</Callout>

## Electronegativity and covalent bonds

When two atoms share electrons unequally, a **polar covalent bond** results. 

Electrons tend to spend more time around the more electronegative atom. The result is a partial negative charge (*not* a complete transfer of charge). It is represented by <InlineMath text="\delta +" /> ("partially positive") or <InlineMath text="\delta -" /> ("partially negative").

A molecule is **dipole** if it has two significantly differently charged poles, due to significant differences in electronegativity.
