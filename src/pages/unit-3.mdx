# Types of Reactions

Synthesis reaction - two substances (generally elements) combine and form a compound. 

Ionic compounds as products are always solids. 

Decomposition reaction - a compound breaks up into the elements or in a few to simpler compounds. 

- carbonates produce carbon dioxide gas
- nitrates produce nitrogen oxide gases
- sulfates produce sulfur oxide gases
- chlorates produce oxygen gas
- oxide produces oxygen gas
- hydroxides produce water vapor
- peroxides (e.g. H2O2) produce oxygen gas and oxides (e.g. O2+ H2O)
- metal oxide + water = base
- non metal oxide + water = acid

Combustion reaction - occur when a hydrocarbon reacts with oxygen gas (also known as burning). 

Fire triangle: a fuel (hydrocarbon), oxygen to burn it with, spark to ignite it. 

Products in combustion are always carbon dioxide and water (although incomplete burning does cause some by-products like carbon monoxide). 

# Balancing Equations

- balance only one element at a time
- balance single elements last
- leave oxygen and hydrogen to balance last
- polyatomic ions that remain unchanged from reactant side to product side, keep as one balance these first

Don't forget to re-check the equation at the end, as amounts may have shifted. 

# Weights and Masses

Formula weight (FW) - sum of the atomic weights for the atoms in a chemical formula. 

Molecular weight (MW) - the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms in a molecule. 

Ionic compounds form three-dimensional crystal structures, so they only have empirical formulas and formula weights, not molecular formulas or molecular weights. 

Molar mass - mass of 1 mol of a substance. 

This is the mass listed on the periodic table (e.g. carbon has a mass of 12.01 g/mol, also 12.01 amu). 

# Avogadro's Number

Avogadro's Number is ~6.022 * 10^23

It's the number of particles in 1 mol. 

A mol is a unit like a dozen, it's a measure of items of a type. 

1 mol H2O contains 2 mol hydrogen and 1 mol oxygen

Moles are used to convert between grams and number of atoms or molecules of a substance â€” they're the connector unit. 

# Determining Empirical Formula from Percent Composition

Learn by example: 

**question:** 

*A compound of B and H is 81.10% B. What is its empirical formula?* 

**answer:** 

When given percentages, use 100g to calculate

81.10g B * (1 mol / 10.81g) = 7.502 mol B

100 - 81.10g H * (1 mol / 1.01g) = 18.713 mol H

Divide each calculated result by lower number of moles: 

7.502 / 7.502 = 1

18.713 / 7.502 = about 2.5 *(you'll have to round, there's always experimental error)*

Then, multiply to get a whole-number empirical formula from that ratio

B2H5

# Determining Molecular Formula from Empirical Formula

For this you need the molecular mass, which is found through experimentation. 

Then, take the mass of the empirical formula (e.g. C2H3 = 27 g/mol) and compare with molecular mass (e.g. 81 g/mol), to find how much you need to multiply the empirical formula by to get the molecular formula (e.g. 81/27 = 3, so molecular formula is C6H9). 

# Hydrates

A hydrate is a salt that when crystallized forms an aqueous solution that incorporates a fixed amount of water in its crystalline matrix, even while appearing dry. 

The number of moles of water present per one more of anhydrous salt is usually a simple whole number. 

## Calculation

1. calculate the mass lost during the heating, which is the mass of H2O lost
2. calculate moles of H2O lost
3. calculate moles of substance *not including water*
4. similarly to finding empirical formulas, divide and find the ratio of substance : H2O

# Combustion Analysis

in these problems, you are given the mass of the hydrocarbon, and resulting masses of CO2 and H2O. 

C is determined by calculating moles of CO2 produced. 

H is determined by calculating moles of H2O produced, then multiplying by two (because it's H2, there's 2 mol H per 1 mol H2O). 

If the hydrocarbon is of the form C_H_O_ or C_H_N_, you can calculate the mass of the O or N by subtracting the masses of C and H from the mass of the hydrocarbon. 

Then, find the moles of O or N, and find the empirical formula by dividing moles by the lowest number of moles (like usual) and finding the ratio. 

# Limiting Reactant

The limiting reactant is the one that will be used up first in the reaction, and restricts the amount of product that can be created. 

- to calculate which reactant is the limiting reactant, convert the amount of each reactant given to moles
- then, compare these amounts with the moles of reactant needed (remember, the coefficient = the # of moles needed)
- just thinking about these ratios should make clear which reactant is limiting
